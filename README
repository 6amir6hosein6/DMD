# Latent Fingerprint Matching via Dense Minutia Descriptor

This repository contains the code for the paper "Latent Fingerprint Matching via Dense Minutia Descriptor".

## Overview

The code in this repository implements the methods described in the paper to match latent fingerprints using a dense minutia descriptor approach. This method aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of latent fingerprint matching by leveraging a detailed descriptor of minutiae points.
